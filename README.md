# Porikkha-The-Ultimate-Teacher-Solution


### Project Overview


* E X A M S - W R I T T EN   B U T   ONL INE ? School teachers could benefit so much from a technology
that would make the task of assessment of handwritten scanned answer PDFs easier.

* We have developed an innovative web baed portal that will ease the teaher's work of checking scanned answer scripts and marking them immediately.

### Solution Description

Our solution involved checking of the answer-scripts that are submitted by students. At present, there is no way to check the papers live and mark them immediately. The teacher has to use a software and pen and paper simultaneosly. This makes it extremely difficult for the teachers to check the papers. Our Solution allows the teacher to create custom exam halls for students, allowing the students to join the same thus reducing the need for attendance. The student can submit his answer script directly through the said portal. The answer script shall be saved under his name and teacher shall be able to access it. The teacher can see the question paper and answer script side by side, he can read the answer and immediately mark it digitally agianst the written answer on the side panel provided which will calculte total marks. The marks shall be saved, making it easy for the teacher for rechecking the papers. In future plans, we shall make the PDF overwritable so that teacher can also mark the mistakes as he checks and the markings will be saved too.

#### Technical Description

An overview of:
* HTML CSS JAVASCRIPT........Node JS for back-end, MODEL VIEW CONTROLLER in VSCode

* Once the backend and frontend is integrated one can login/Register to our app as a teacher who can create classrooms in the class hall and in each classroom one can create exam and share the code for the room which any student can access and finally join the room using web sockets ... then the user name and the pdf uploaded can be uploaded in our database using multer and finally the same would be visible to the teacher who can check in our app and update Mark's accordingly
